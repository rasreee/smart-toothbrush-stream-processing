"""
Put your unit tests here.

Use the builtin `unittest` module. The documentation is out there. You have
free reign in this folder to do what you need to do to make sure we can run
your tests.

You can also import another library you
like better. Just try to avoid things that are too magic, or we won't be able
to understand what your actual test coverage is.
